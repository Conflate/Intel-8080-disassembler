# Intel 8080 Disassembler
A basic disassembler for the Intel 8080 assembly language



## About
This project revolves around producing a quality disassembler for the Intel 8080. This is a personal project of mine that I am pursuing with the goal of gaining a deeper understanding of the C programming language and lower level concepts surrounding the CPU. 


## Planned features
1. Completion of project (obviously)
2. Add parameters for outputting disassembly results to stdout or to a .asm file
3. Possibly add basic debugging capabilities in the future.

This is a small stepping stone in a significantly larger project which involves creating a fully functioning Intel-8080 CPU emulator with a final goal of having a fully functioning 8080 emulator.

Currently, the assembler is lacking basic functionality and I will be gradually updating it. I will be considering creating a simplified tutorial of programming disassemblers for beginners.

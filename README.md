#Intel 8080 Disassembler

#About 
This project revolves around producing a quality disassembler for the Intel 8080. This is a personal project of mine, that I'm pursuing as a way to gain a deeper understanding of the C programming language, and a deeper understanding of lower level concepts revolving around the CPU. 


#Planned features
1. Completion of project (obviously)
2. Add parameters for outputting disassembly results to stdout, or to a .asm file
3. Possibly add basic debugging capabilities in the future.

This is simply a stepping stone in a significantly larger project involving creating a fully functioning Intel-8080 CPU emulator, with a final goal of having a fully functioning 8080 emulator.

As of right now the assembler is not close to even having basic functionality, I will be updating it over time, and perhaps making a simplified tutorial of programming disassemblers for beginners.
